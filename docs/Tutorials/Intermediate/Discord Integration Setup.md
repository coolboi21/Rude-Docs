> [!WARNING]
> While the image you choose can be of any size, we suggest selecting an image that has a `4:3` aspect ratio.


### Step 2: Uploading your image 
Go to any site that you can upload images (**and host them!**) we use `https://imgbb.com/` in this tutorial. 

Then upload your image and then right click the image and click on the button that says `Copy image address`.
